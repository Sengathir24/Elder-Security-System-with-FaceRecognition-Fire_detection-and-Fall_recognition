# Elder Security System


The Elder Security System is a comprehensive solution designed to ensure the safety and well-being of elderly individuals living independently. This system combines advanced technologies including face recognition, fall detection using OpenCV, and fire detection using Haar Cascade classifiers to provide round-the-clock monitoring and immediate response to potential risks or emergencies.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Identify authorized individuals and monitor entry/exit.
- **Fall Detection**: Detect and respond to falls or accidents in real-time.
- **Fire Detection**: Detect fires or smoke in the environment and trigger immediate alerts.
